        This method is automatically called by Django during the startup process.
        It is used here to import and activate signals defined in the 'users' app.

        Signals are a way to allow decoupled applications to get notified when certain
        actions occur elsewhere in the application.

        Note:
            The 'import users.signals' statement is included here to ensure that the
            signals are registered when the 'users' app is ready.
